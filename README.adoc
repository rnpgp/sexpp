# SEXP---(S-expressions) parser and generator library

S-expressions are a data structure for representing complex data. They are a variation on LISP S-expressions. (Lisp was invented by John McCarthy).
S-expressions were adopted for use in http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/sdsi.html[SDSI] and http://world.std.com/~cme/html/spki.html[SPKI]. The work reported here is, however, application-independent. (That is, we will use S-expressions in the SPKI/SDSI work, but have developed it and presented it in an application-independent manner, so that others may most easily consider adopting it for other applications.)

SDSI has been developed by Professors https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/index.html[Ronald L. Rivest] and Butler Lampson of http://www.lcs.mit.edu/[MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science], members of http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis[LCS's Cryptography and Information Security] research group.

SDSI research has been supported by DARPA contract DABT63-96-C-0018, "Security for Distributed Computer Systems".

SPKI has been developed by http://www.clark.net/pub/cme/home.html[Carl Ellison] and others in the IETF SPKI working group.

## C++ code

The library is a deep rework to C++ of original SEXP library https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/sexp.html that maintains full support of original specification. Sample client application  reads and parses S-expressions. It also prints out the S-expressions in a variety of formats.
While that most applications will not need anything but the simple canonical and transport formats; however, the code here is considerably more complex because it also supports the advanced format, both for input and for output.) The "sexp-main" program also contains some documentation on running the program. (Or just type "sexp -h" to get the help print-out.) The code is available under the "MIT License" (open source).
